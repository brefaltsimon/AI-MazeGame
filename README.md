# AI-MazeGame

A AI project created in the course TSBK03 at Link√∂pings University.

## Idea

The idea of the project is to creat a game AI that will behave as guards in a maze.
The AI will patrol the maze with a lot of spread.

Project is created in Unity with C# scripting

# Update
currently only the scripting code is up for the different scripts used.
GuardBehaviour.cs holds most of the project including the functions for using A* pathfinding and the use of influence maps.
